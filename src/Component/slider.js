<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The foundations of the present education system were laid by Sir Sultan Mohamed Shah, Aga  Khan III, who established over 200 schools during the 20th century, the first in 1905 in Zanzibar and Balochistan, followed by schools in Dar es Salaam in 1906 and in Mundra, in India, in 1907.
<br />
The Aga Khan Schools strive to create a harmonious balance between academic demands, sporting and cultural activities and community life.
<br />
It challenges its pupils to be intellectually inquisitive and socially conscious. The School believes that while what students know is important, the true measure of a student’s education is the ability to analyse what they do not know.
